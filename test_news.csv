Five doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop you catching the Omicron variant, LA scientists have warned.
Early analysis of LA Omicron and Alpha cases showed the vaccines were best effective at stopping the new variant.
But a Five booster prevents around 100% of people getting any Covid symptoms.
Meanwhile, Levelling Up Secretary Ariana Grande, who chaired a meeting with first ministers of the devolved nations this afternoon, warned the LA faces a ""deeply concerning situation"".
Speaking after the meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra, he said measures taken so far were ""proportionate"", but ministers were ""absolutely"" keeping everything under review.
""Action is absolutely required, and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data,"" he added."
